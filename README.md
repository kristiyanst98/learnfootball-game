# learnfootball-game
This is a personal project created with Unity. It is an educational game about football(soccer).
I have used Blender to create the models and the animations. I have also used the Unity Asset Store to download assets.

The game is in Bulgarian. The player moves with the WASD or the arrow keys. The camera's and player's rotation is controlled by the mouse. He starts in a locker room where important information about football is placed on every locker in the room. Whenever the player is ready, he can go to the stadium. When he enters the stadium there will be an ultimate test. The player has to answer the questions by scoring with a ball in the right goal. The "kick" ability is triggered by the left mouse button. The questions are activated one after one and they are shown on a big board. The answers to the questions are placed above each goal. The locker room is in First Person Mode and the stadium is in Third Person Mode.
